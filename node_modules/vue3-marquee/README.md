A simple marquee component with ZERO dependencies for Vue 3. This component was originally developed for internal use but I figured this could be useful to someone else as well. This component is modeled after a React marquee component I found called [React Fast Marquee](https://github.com/justin-chu/react-fast-marquee). To keep a smooth animation running, clones of the content can be created for seamless transitions with no sudden jarring appearences or empty spaces in between content.

# Upgrade to v3.x

If you are using version 1.x or 2.x of `vue3-marquee` you should upgrade to version 3.x. You can do this by running the [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-usage) command below. This adds TS support for the component. There are some new imports so take a look at the [new documentation](https://vue3-marquee.vercel.app/guide.html#usage).

# Installation and Usage

## Vue 3

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

- Register the component in your Vue 3 application.

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount('#app')
```

To define global components for [Volar type-checking](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/tree/master/extensions/vscode-vue-language-features#usage) you will need to add:

```ts
// components.d.ts
declare module '@vue/runtime-core' {
  export interface GlobalComponents {
    LottieAnimation: typeof import('vue3-marquee')['Vue3Marquee']
  }
}
export {}
```

If needed rename component to use:

```ts
app.use(Vue3Marquee, { name: 'MarqueeAnimation' }) // use in template <MarqueeAnimation />
```

- `name` string (default: 'Vue3Marquee') - set custom component name

Alternatively you can also import the component locally.

```js
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
```

You can then use the component in your template

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>

<script>
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
</script>
```

## Nuxt 3

This is still experimental. Will be updated soon.

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

- Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.
- Create a file named **`vue3-marquee.client.js`** inside the _plugins_ directory.
- Add the following code to the **`vue3-marquee.client.js`** file.

```js
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Vue3Marquee)
})
```

- Import the css file required by the component into your **`app.vue`** file.

```js
import 'vue3-marquee/dist/style.css'
```

# Events

A few events are emitted from the component. Look at the [Demos](#Demos) for examples.

- onComplete
  - If your marquee has a finite amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed.
- onLoopComplete
  - If your marquee has a finite amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed a loop.
- onPause
  - This event is emitted if you have either `pauseOnHover` or `pauseOnClick` enabled. It will notify if the animation pauses.
- onResume
  - This event is emitted if you have either `pauseOnHover` or `pauseOnClick` enabled. It will notify if the animation resumes.
